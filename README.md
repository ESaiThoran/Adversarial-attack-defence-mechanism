Adversarial attack defense system that integrates advanced deep learning techniques, combining Auto-encoder, Block-switching, and Grad-CAM methodologies to create a robust and sophisticated image classification architecture. The project addresses critical vulnerabilities in machine learning models by implementing a multi-layered defense mechanism that not only classifies images but also identifies and mitigates potential adversarial attacks.
The architectural framework encompasses several sophisticated stages:

Advanced Image Processing Pipeline: The system initiates with a comprehensive image classification process, simultaneously building a supervised dataset of both original and adversarial images. The Auto-encoder plays a crucial role in noise removal, systematically eliminating potential attack-induced perturbations and generating a clean, preprocessed image for further analysis.
Intelligent Defense Mechanisms: The Block-switching model introduces randomized sub-channel selection, adding an unpredictability layer that makes the system more resilient against targeted adversarial attacks. Grad-CAM's activation mapping provides visual explanations of the model's decision-making process, highlighting critical image regions and enabling anomaly detection with unprecedented precision.

Key Technical Innovations:

Multi-stage defense architecture with tightly coupled components
Noise removal through advanced Auto-encoder techniques
Randomized Block-switching for enhanced model robustness
Grad-CAM visualization for transparent decision explanations
Comprehensive adversarial attack detection and mitigation
